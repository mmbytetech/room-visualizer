# room-visualizer

## Project Background
The **Room Visualizer** is an interactive 3D room visualization tool that takes JSON files containing room dimensions and shape data. This app visualizes rooms of random shapes with straight-line walls (e.g., triangle, simple, or T-shape). The dimensions of the room, including length and width, are automatically determined based on the walls' coordinates described in JSON files. 

The purpose of the app is to offer a simple, real-time visualization of different room shapes, allowing users to view the room's dimensions and adjust them through an interactive interface.

### Features
- Random room shapes like **Triangle**, **Simple**, and **T-shape**.
- Interactive 3D visualization of room shapes with adjustable length and width.
- Option to change dimensions of the room dynamically with a button click.
- Seamless and responsive user experience using Vue.js, Three.js, and Jest for testing.
